<p>ASA + WLT</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>World Locking Tools for Unity (WLT) provides a stable coordinate system based on local tracking. When combined with Azure Spatial Anchors (ASA), that stable coordinate system can be persisted across sessions, and shared across devices.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://youtu.be/28lYjbQh8RA">accompanying video</a> for visual clarification.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-in-this-sample">What is in this sample?</h2>
<p>This sample provides assets and scripts to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure Unity's global coordinate system with respect to the physical environment.</li>
<li>Publish that coordinate system configuration to Azure using Azure Spatial Anchors.</li>
<li>Retrieve the data from Azure to restore the coordinate system in later sessions or on other devices.</li>

<h2 id="setup-and-tested-versions">Setup and tested versions</h2>
<p>This sample has been developed and tested using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity 2020.3.2f1</li>
<li>Azure Spatial Anchors (ASA) v2.9.0</li>
<li>Mixed Reality Toolkit v2.6.2</li>
<li>World Locking Tools for Unity v1.3.6</li>
<li>FrozenWorldEngine v1.1.1</li>
</ul>
<p>It has been verified from those original versions through the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unity 2020.3.8f1</li>
<li>Azure Spatial Anchors (ASA) v2.12.0</li>
<li>Mixed Reality Toolkit v2.7.3</li>
<li>World Locking Tools for Unity v1.5.8</li>
<li>FrozenWorldEngine v1.1.1</li>
</ul>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>There appears to be an issue with AR Foundation v4.0.12 and ASA v2.12.0, which causes ASA failure at creating local anchors, and generally breaking the sample. Updating to AR Foundation v4.1.9 fixes this problem.</p>
</div>
<p>The following instructions assume you are starting from the Unity assets as included in the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MixedReality-WorldLockingTools-Samples">WLT Samples github repo</a>. Specifically, installing WLT and/or MRTK for this sample from the Mixed Reality Feature Tool is not supported.</p>
<h3 id="install-the-frozen-world-engine-dll-into-the-project">Install the Frozen World Engine DLL into the project</h3>
<p>The first step is to install the Frozen World Engine DLL, v1.1.1. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality/world-locking-tools/documentation/howtos/initialsetup#frozenworld-engine-installation">Instructions here</a>, using either NuGet for Unity, or command line nuget.exe.</p>
<h3 id="install-asa">Install ASA</h3>
<h4 id="creating-spatial-anchor-resources">Creating spatial anchor resources</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/quickstarts/get-started-unity-hololens?tabs=azure-portal">Quick Start Guide</a> goes through the steps to create an Azure account and the necessary spatial anchors resources. The Account Id, Account Domain, and Account Key will be necessary to run the sample. You will add them into the proper fields on the &quot;Spatial Anchor Manager&quot; script, on the SpacePinBinder object in the scene. Other authentication methods are supported, but the Account Id/Domain/Key is the easiest when getting started.</p>
<p><img src="../../DocGen/Images/ASA/InspectorAccount.jpg" alt="Credentials fields"></p>
<h4 id="install-the-sdk">Install the SDK</h4>
<p>Next, install Azure Spatial Anchors v2.9.0 using one of the methods described in <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/how-tos/setup-unity-project?tabs=unity-package-web-ui">these instructions</a>. I used the MR Feature Tool method.</p>
<h3 id="additional-setup-for-coarse-relocation">Additional setup for Coarse Relocation</h3>
<p>When using Coarse Relocation, additional setup is required when deploying to Android or HoloLens2.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-coarse-relocation">What is Coarse Relocation?</h4>
<p>Coarse Relocation is a technology which allows you to search for previously created cloud anchors within your current vicinity. Additional details on Course Relocation can be found in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/concepts/coarse-reloc">Course Relocation section of the Azure Spatial Anchors documentation</a>.</p>
<p>This sample demonstrates finding cloud anchors either by Coarse Relocation, or explicitly by cloud anchor id (GUID). If Coarse Relocation is enabled, the following additional setup steps are required. If you aren't interested in Coarse Relocation, you can disable it in the &quot;Publisher ASA&quot; component on the SpacePinBinder object.</p>
<p><img src="../../DocGen/Images/ASA/InspectorPublisher.jpg" alt="Disabling coarse relocation"></p>
<h4 id="additional-setup-steps-for-hololens2">Additional setup steps for HoloLens2</h4>
<p>To enable Coarse Relocation on HoloLens2, you must add a permission to the Package.appxmanifest file generated into ARM/WLT_ASA/Package.appxmanifest (assuming you selected the folder ARM as your build target). Add the following line into the Capabilities section:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">    &lt;DeviceCapability Name=&quot;wiFiControl&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-spatial-anchors-samples/issues/98#issuecomment-574235197">this post on github</a>.</p>
<p>In Project Settings/XR Plugin Management, make sure that Windows Mixed Reality is the selected Plugin-Provider under the UWP tab (OpenXR is also supported for WLT, but not tested yet with ASA).</p>
<p>The MRTK profile <code>XAmple XRSDK ToolkitConfigurationProfile</code> in XAmpleApp/CustomProfiles is suitable for running on HoloLens2.</p>
<h4 id="additional-setup-steps-for-android">Additional setup steps for Android</h4>
<p>To enable Coarse Relocation on Android, follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/how-tos/setup-unity-project?tabs=unity-package-web-ui#android-only-configure-the-maintemplategradle-file">these instructions</a> to configure the Assets/Plugins/Android/mainTemplate.gradle file. This should be included in the project already, but is worth checking. For your own project, you would have to configure that yourself.</p>
<p>Also, in the Assets/Plugins/Android/AndroidManifest.xml included in the project, a lot of permissions are enabled in order to allow access to Wi-Fi on Android. Again, if incorporating elements of this project into your own project, you need to follow these steps as well in order to use Coarse Relocation. More details on required permissions to access Wi-Fi on Android are in <a href="https://answers.unity.com/questions/1543095/cant-enable-wifi-in-unity-on-android-device-duplic.html">this post</a>, and the post it links to.</p>
<p>When you hit Build &amp; Run, if your build fails with a Shader error in the MRTK_Standard material, just try Build &amp; Run again. It works second try for me. There is some info on that in the MRTK issues, but as far as I can tell all the info there is incorrect.</p>
<p>In Project Settings/XR Plugin Management, make sure that ARCore is the selected Plugin-Provider under the Android tab.</p>
<p>The MRTK profile <code>XAmple AR ToolkitConfigurationProfile</code> is suitable for running on mobile. Don't forget to run the script <code>Mixed Reality Toolkit/Utilities/UnityAR/Update Scripting Defines</code> after switching to Android or iOS.</p>
<h2 id="video-walkthrough">Video walkthrough</h2>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/28lYjbQh8RA">This video</a> might give you an idea what to expect when running the sample. Further details follow.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-buttons-do">What the buttons do</h2>
<p><img src="../../DocGen/Images/ASA/ReadyHL2.jpg" alt="Ready"></p>
<ul>
<li>Toggle Pins - When the SpacePins are not active, their manipulation handles may be hidden.</li>
<li>Publish - Save the current configuration, enabling its retrieval in later session or on other devices.</li>
<li>Load Oracle - Use previously stored bindings to restore a spatial configuration.</li>
<li>Clear Oracle - Delete all backing resources, especially Azure spatial anchors, and clear the bindings oracle.</li>
<li>Search - Find all Azure spatial anchors in the immediate vicinity, and restore the spatial configuration from them.</li>
<li>Purge - Find all Azure spatial anchors in the immediate vicinity, and clear them.</li>
<li>Reset Pins - Undo any Space Pin manipulations. Does not clear any Azure spatial anchors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The menu on mobile is slightly different in form, but button positions and meanings are the same.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough---publish-from-hololens2">Walkthrough - Publish from HoloLens2</h2>
<h3 id="place-the-scene-using-spacepins">Place the scene using SpacePins</h3>
<p>When you start up the sample, the coordinate system is position and oriented based on the head tracker pose at startup. Which is to say, it is fairly arbitrary. The first thing to do is to adjust the coordinate system to a desired reference state.</p>
<p>The sofa in the PinTestSofa scene is 2.18 meters long, 0.78m high, and 1.0m deep. The SpacePin handles on each end of the top back of the sofa are, therefore, 2.18m apart, and 0;78m off the ground. I recommend measuring and placing temporary markers 2.18m apart, at some convenient height. Alternatively, you can adjust the scene to fit your physical space.</p>
<p>Having built and deployed the application to a HoloLens2 device, wait until the status on the floating menu says Ready (hint - the status line will go from red to white when ready).</p>
<p><img src="../../DocGen/Images/ASA/NotReadyHL2.jpg" alt="Not ready"></p>
<p>One at a time, grab each of the SpacePin handles (the white wireframe spheres) and drag it into position relative to your reference markers.</p>
<p>After releasing each of the markers into position, the scene should have shifted to restore the back of the sofa relative to the SpacePin. The objects in the scene aren't being moved, the entire coordinate space is adjusted so that the original coordinates of the SpacePins are at the location in the physical world that you dragged them to.</p>
<h3 id="publish-the-coordinate-space">Publish the coordinate space</h3>
<p>Having established the space that you want, you can now Publish that space to make it available in later sessions and on other devices.</p>
<p>If using Coarse Relocation, it's a good idea to clear out any previously created cloud anchors at this point. Hit the &quot;Purge from Search&quot; button and wait for that to complete.</p>
<p>Now, on the floating menu, hit the &quot;Publish&quot; button and wait for it to complete.</p>
<p><img src="../../DocGen/Images/ASA/ReadyHL2.jpg" alt="Ready"></p>
<h2 id="walkthrough---consume-from-hololens2-using-coarse-relocation">Walkthrough - Consume from HoloLens2 using Coarse Relocation</h2>
<p>Start the application again on a different HoloLens2 device, or on the same device after closing the previous session. When the status shows as Ready, press the &quot;Load from Search&quot; button. When the operation completes, the Unity global coordinate system will have realigned to your physical environment as it was in the previous (Published) session.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough---consume-from-hololens2-using-ibindingoracle-spacepinbinderfile">Walkthrough - Consume from HoloLens2 using IBindingOracle (SpacePinBinderFile)</h2>
<p>When the bindings are published on a device, or when they are restored from search, they are recorded into an IBindingOracle. This sample includes the most basic Oracle, one that simply writes the bindings to a text file.</p>
<p>Restart the application to a new session. If this is the same HoloLens2 as the Publish was performed from, then there is a binding file left from the publish. If this is a different HoloLens2, but a Search was successfully performed in a previous session, then the binding file will be left from that.</p>
<p>Hit the &quot;Load from File&quot; button to load the previously recorded bindings and restore that coordinate space.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough---consume-from-android-using-coarse-relocation">Walkthrough - Consume from Android using Coarse Relocation</h2>
<p>The UX looks slightly different on Android, but works exactly the same. The main difference is that a little more scanning of the environment at startup is required relative to HoloLens2, before ASA is ready to proceed.</p>
<p>When the system shows as Ready, you can hit the blue button (3rd from right) to search for the previously published bindings and restore the coordinate system.</p>
<h2 id="walkthrough---consume-from-android-using-ibindingoracle-spacepinbinderfile">Walkthrough - Consume from Android using IBindingOracle (SpacePinBinderFile)</h2>
<p>Having successfully completed a Load from Search, a bindings file has been left on the device. In later sessions you can just hit Load from File to restore the coordinate system.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could just copy the bindings text file from the publishing device to the consuming device. The default location of the bindings text file is:</p>
<p>HoloLens2: User Folders/LocalAppData/WLT-ASA/LocalState/BinderFile.txt</p>
<p>Android: Internal shared storage/Android/data/com.WorldLockingTools.WLTASA/files/BinderFile.txt</p>
<h2 id="software-overview">Software overview</h2>
<h3 id="ibinder---binding-spacepins-to-azure-spatial-anchors">IBinder - binding SpacePins to Azure Spatial Anchors</h3>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IBinder.html">IBinding</a> interface is at the center. It is implemented here by the <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.SpacePinBinder.html">SpacePinBinder class</a>. It is a Unity Monobehaviour, and may be configured either from Unity's Inspector or from script.</p>
<p>Each IBinder is <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IBinder.html#Microsoft_MixedReality_WorldLocking_ASA_IBinder_Name">named</a>, so a single <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IBindingOracle.html">IBindingOracle</a> can manage bindings for multiple IBindings.</p>
<h3 id="ipublisher---reading-and-writing-spatial-anchors-to-the-cloud">IPublisher - reading and writing spatial anchors to the cloud</h3>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IPublisher.html">IPublisher</a> interface handles publishing spatial anchors to the cloud, and then retrieving them in later sessions or on other devices. It is implemented here with the <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.PublisherASA.html">PublisherASA class</a>. Pose data in the current physical space is captured and retrieved using Azure Spatial Anchors.</p>
<p>When a spatial anchor is published, a cloud anchor id is obtained. This id may be used in later sessions or on other devices to retrieve the cloud anchor's pose in the current coordinate system, along with any properties stored with it. The system always adds a property identifying the cloud anchor's associated SpacePin.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the IPublisher, and the PublisherASA, don't know anything about SpacePins. IPublisher doesn't know or care what will be done with the cloud anchor data. It simply provides a simplified awaitable interface for publishing and retrieving cloud anchors.</p>
<h4 id="read-versus-find">Read versus Find</h4>
<p>If a cloud anchor's id is known, the cloud anchor may be retrieved by its id. This is the most robust way to retrieve a cloud anchor. This is <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IPublisher.html#Microsoft_MixedReality_WorldLocking_ASA_IPublisher_Read_">Read</a>.</p>
<p>However, there are interesting scenarios in which the ids for the cloud anchors within an area aren't known by a device, but if they cloud anchors could be retrieved, their spatial data and properties would combine to provide enough information to make them useful.</p>
<p><a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IPublisher.html#Microsoft_MixedReality_WorldLocking_ASA_IPublisher_Find_">Find</a> searches the area around a device for cloud anchors, and returns any that it was able to identify. This process is known as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/spatial-anchors/how-tos/set-up-coarse-reloc-unity">coarse relocation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ibindingoracle---sharing-cloud-anchor-ids">IBindingOracle - sharing cloud anchor ids</h3>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IBindingOracle.html">IBindingOracle interface</a> provides a means of persisting and sharing bindings between SpacePins and specific cloud anchors. Specifically, it persists space-pin-id/cloud-anchor-id pairs, along with the name of the IBinder.</p>
<p>The oracle's interface is extremely simple. Given an IBinder, it can either <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IBindingOracle.html#Microsoft_MixedReality_WorldLocking_ASA_IBindingOracle_Put_">Put</a> the IBinder's bindings, or it can <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IBindingOracle.html#Microsoft_MixedReality_WorldLocking_ASA_IBindingOracle_Get_">Get</a> them. Put stores them, and Get retrieves them. The mechanism of storage and retrieval is left to the implementation of the concrete class implementing the IBindingOracle interface.</p>
<p>This sample implements possibly the simplest possible IBindingOracle, in the form of the <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.SpacePinBinder.html">SpacePinBinderFile class</a>. On Put, it writes the IBinder's bindings to a text file. On Get, it reads them from the text file (if available) and feeds them into the IBinder.</p>
<h3 id="ilocalpeg---blob-marking-a-position-in-physical-space">ILocalPeg - blob marking a position in physical space</h3>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.ILocalPeg.html">ILocalPeg interface</a> is an abstraction of a device local anchor. In a more perfect world, the required ILocalPegs would be internally managed by the IPublisher. However, device local anchors work much better when created while the device is in the vicinity of the anchor's pose. The IPublisher only knows where the device local anchors should be placed when they are needed, not at the optimal time of creating them.</p>
<p>The <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.SpacePinASA.html">SpacePinASA</a> does know when the best time to create its local anchor is. When the manipulation of the SpacePin ends and its pose set, the SpacePinASA requests the IPublisher to <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IPublisher.html#Microsoft_MixedReality_WorldLocking_ASA_IPublisher_CreateLocalPeg_">create an opaque local peg</a> at the desired pose. The SpacePinBinder then pulls the ILocalPeg off the SpacePinASA, and passes it to the IPublisher to be used in <a class="xref" href="../../DocGen/Temp/api/Microsoft.MixedReality.WorldLocking.ASA.IPublisher.html#Microsoft_MixedReality_WorldLocking_ASA_IPublisher_Create_">creating a cloud spatial anchor</a>.</p>
