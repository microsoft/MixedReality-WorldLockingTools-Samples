## Prerequisites

The basics of building and deploying a HoloLens application from Unity are assumed. If you aren't familiar with that, [here's a good place to start](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/holograms-101). Or if you want to go straight to HoloLens2, then [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/mrlearning-base).

For the Advanced samples, obviously familiarity with the basic World Locking Tools for Unity is assumed. Start [here](https://microsoft.github.io/MixedReality-WorldLockingTools-Unity/DocGen/Documentation/GettingStartedWithWorldLocking.html).

The Tutorials are most useful as auxiliary information for the documentation. Start with the documentation, and jump to the Tutorials when the documentation directs you there for illustration.
