# Advanced samples

This is the home for advanced samples of the use of World Locking Tools for Unity (WLT).

An "advanced" sample should meet one or more of the following characteristics:

1. Demonstrates the use of a lesser used WLT feature.
2. Uses WLT along with an external library/system in a way that enhances the value of both.
3. Accomplishes an otherwise difficult scenario using WLT in a novel way.
4. Clarifies an otherwise difficult to grasp WLT concept via a concrete example.

The following samples are currently available.

[Align Sub Scene](AlignSubScene/AlignSubScene.md) - Multiple subspaces aligned independently.

[QR Space Pins](QRSpacePins/QRSpacePins.md) - Printed QR codes used as external markers to align the Unity coordinate space with the physical world.

[WLT + ASA](ASA/ASA.md) - Manipulating the global coordinate system using World Locking Tools, and then sharing that coordinate space across sessions and devices via Azure Spatial Anchors.
